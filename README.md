## Play here: http://anti-fascist-heroine-addiction.surge.sh/

Do you ever wish you could chase Ted Cruz’s disembodied head around a game board and then punch it repeatedly, accompanied by cheesy 8-bit sound effects?

Do you enjoy software coded by someone with the skills of a distracted fourth-grader?

How about crappy animation, no coherent narrative, an extremely gay color scheme, and some gratuitous Hanukkah-themed elements thrown in for no reason at all except one of my kids thought it would be a good idea?

Well have I got a game for you!

Eat food you find in the grid to stay alive. It takes strength to fight monsters. Walk into a food to eat it.

#### Your team

Gather a team of superheroes to help you fight monsters. You can’t do it alone! Each member of your team adds attack strength. Walk into a superhero to add her to your team.

#### Monsters

Each monster your team defeats gives you experience points. It takes 100 XP to level up. You’ll need all the experience you can get to defeat the final monster. Walk into a monster repeatedly until you defeat it... or it defeats you!

#### Staircases

![staircase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rifkegribenes/dungeon-crawler/master/src/img/staircase_32_c.png) Staircases take you down to the next level of the dungeon. In ‘Medium’ and ‘Hard’ difficulty levels, staircases are hidden until your character has enough XP to level up.

#### Winning the game

To win, defeat the final monster on level 3.</div>
